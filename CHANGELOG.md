### Features

* **API v1 Migration**: Complete migration to endoflife.date API v1 with all endpoints
  - Migrated base URL from `/api` to `/api/v1`
  - Updated all endpoints to v1 structure (`/products`, `/products/{product}`, `/products/{product}/releases/{release}`)
  - Added support for 7 new v1 API endpoints:
    - `GET /products/full` - Bulk data dump of all products
    - `GET /products/{product}/releases/latest` - Latest release for a product
    - `GET /categories` - List all categories
    - `GET /categories/{category}` - Products by category
    - `GET /tags` - List all tags
    - `GET /tags/{tag}` - Products by tag
    - `GET /identifiers` - List identifier types
  - Proper URL encoding for special characters in cycle names (e.g., slashes)
  - Enhanced response validation with Zod schemas

* **Extended API Fields**: Full support for all v1 API fields
  - `discontinued` - Track hardware/device discontinuation dates
  - `extendedSupport` - Identify products with extended support options
  - `latestReleaseDate` - Detect stale versions with no recent updates
  - `category` - Product categorization
  - `label` - Human-readable product names

* **New Action Inputs**:

  - Updated test mocks to match v1 API response structure
  - Fixed analyzer tests to use v1 endpoints
  - Fixed client tests to use v1 endpoints
  - All 192 tests now passing ✅

* **URL Encoding**: Added proper URL encoding for cycle parameters to handle special characters

### Code Refactoring

* **Type Safety**: Enhanced type definitions with new v1 API schemas
* **Client Architecture**: Streamlined client methods for better maintainability

### Tests

* **Improved Coverage**: Increased test coverage significantly
  - Client coverage: 76% → 81%
  - Added comprehensive tests for all new v1 endpoints
  - Added 15 new test cases for v1 API extensions
  - Total tests: 177 → 192 (+15)
  - All notification channels: 100% coverage
  - All utils: 97.5% coverage

### Documentation

* **README**: Updated to reflect v1 API migration and new features
* **API Migration Guide**: Comprehensive migration documentation in `API_V1_MIGRATION.md`
* **Examples**: Added new example workflows for hardware EOL tracking and staleness detection
* **Code Comments**: Enhanced inline documentation for all new methods

### Performance
